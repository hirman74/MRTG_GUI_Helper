Just a HTA screen to simplify technical staffs to create their own adhoc MRTG graphs. For checking issues on case by case basis.

Mostly requested, adhoc monitoring interface info, are added.

Does not meant to replace the main interface data collection application. 
Only meant to create adhoc monitoring for access switch which is not included in the overall NMM setup.
